Subject: Lab 02 Submission


Lab02 is Mainly devoted to the working of external leds and its connections with the Beaglebone. We made a led glow and blink based on input taken by a push button.We waited till the input is given by the user through push button, and as we recieved input through it, we did two things, first only glowing the led and then afterwards, blinking with respect to the push button.The push button is connected to 5V supply on one side and input pin on beaglebone on the other side. Initially when the button is open, the circuit is open and no input(or 0 logic) is sent to the beaglebone.When Button is pressed the circuit is complete and input of 5v(or 1 logic) is sent  to the beaglebone,and we recieve the input as high.
	
Basically we were trained in the external led working and introduced with the interfacing of push button with the beaglebone.

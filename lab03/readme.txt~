Subject: Lab 03 Submission


Lab03 is Mainly devoted to Playing with analog input by means of a potentiometer and control the brightness of an led by means of PWM of beaglebone.Thehighest value potentiometer can give is 1.8V.The analog input given to the beaglebone is taken from the middle pin of the potentiometer and other pins were connected to the vcc and ground.Then we read the value in beaglebone and took further step of changing the output of the led connected to the analog pins. We used the PWM pins to alter the voltage given to the LED to make it Glow.Hence, we got the led which fades according to the input given by the potentiometer.
	
Basically, this lab was to understand the working of beaglebone with analog inputs and outputs.We got vast understanding of PWM pins.

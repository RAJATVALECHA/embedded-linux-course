Lab07 is devoted to the control and interfacing of accelerometer sensor so as to know the acceleration or orientation of the device to which this sensor is attached.
We were having two types of sensors, one of which(blue one) which was easy to work on and other(ADXL 345(RED COLOR)),so i took red one and worked on it searching a lot on the internet, and vikas worked on blue one.As he succeeded first, so i would say that he worked more on it.
	
4 pins VCC, GND ,XCL and XDA were connected to the beaglebone.gyroscope was interfaced using the analog input pins.  Also, as we get the 16 bit data, so we wrote the javascript code to shift the 16 bit number backward and forward 16 times, in order to get 32 bits with exact same sign convention.
	
Basically, lab was aimed at understanding the interfacing techniques for accelerometers which are very important part of many important projects.Although i have worked earlier too on accelerometers, but this was a new experience studying i2c techniques

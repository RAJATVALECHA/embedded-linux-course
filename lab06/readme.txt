Lab06 is maily devoted to study the interfacing of joystick and rotary encoder with beaglebone.
Joystick--it has four potentiometers on its base.When it is rotated, the values of each of them changes and a combined input is then passed to beaglebone.
Rotary encoder also works on same principle.
	
Basically, it was aimed at knowing the interfacing of Joystick and rotary encoder, which are essential components of many projects.

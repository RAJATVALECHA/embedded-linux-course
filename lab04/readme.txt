Lab04 is mainly devoted to the use of LED Matrix to display required patterns and operate on the matrix by means of other devices like range finders, ultrasonic sensors and joysticks.
Hex adressing modes are used to define the particular led and alter that particular led.we used 8*8 matrix so 2 hex digits were sufficient to control the leds in a row.Then, all these above mentioned devices were also used to control the various leds of the matrix, and build various patterns on it.
	
Basically, it aimed at the control of led matrix using beaglebone and even the outer inputs.

lab05 is devoted to measurement of distance of any object or obstacle by means of any two sensors out of 4 given one's.The sensors work on the principle of reflection of waves sent from the sensors, which on reflection from the surface of the obstacle returns to the reciever in the sensor. Based on the time delay, the distance of the obstacle from the source is calculated.
	
	
	           Ultrasonic sensor Reading (in cm)  				Actual Distance ( in cm)
	           
			           5.4							6.0
			           6.2							7.1
			           6.6							7.2
			           7.5							8.5
			           8.5							9.7
			           10							11.3
			           13							14.7
			           15							17.1
			           20							24.6
			       
	           
	      
We notice that error increases with incrasing distance.
First, the ultrasonic sensor sends the ultrasonic rays which reflects back due to some obstacle, and then after returning is again collected by the sensor itself.the time gap between this going and coming is calliberated and the distance is calculated approximately.
	
Basically, this lab was aimed at checking various distance calculating sensors to get the most reliable one.We worked on ultrasonic sensor and rangefinder sensor.
